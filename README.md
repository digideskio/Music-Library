This repo consists of my work on my final year project, A Sheet Music Library.
I've split this into:
	* documentation, which holds up to date copies of supervisor meeting logs, the initial, interim and final report for hand in, and any other documents I've created.
	* implementation, which holds my own python code produced. In here once implemented, there will be folders for:
		* each primary objective held in the primaries folder
		* each secondary objective held in the secondaries folder
	* research, which holds a load of stuff other people have done. Once open sourced I need to remind myself to delete these to avoid any problems with licensing.
