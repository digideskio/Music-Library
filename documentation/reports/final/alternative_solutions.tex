\subsection{Alternative Solutions}
This section discusses other software which is currently available for musicians to organise and view sheet music.

Table \ref{table:software} shows the alternative options considered in the area of Sheet Music organisation automation. This shows that the closest alternative would be Power Music Pro, though much of the functionality changes slightly according to the platform it has been developed for \parencite{PowerMusic}. Furthermore, Power Music Pro's only improvement on manual organisation is the ability to search by lyric, whilst this project intends to allow for a cross section of other organisation techniques, as explained in the problem context.

Additionally, each of the possible options are released in a commercial environment, with Avid's Photoscore being too expensive for the average user.  Seemingly, this project would constitute the only free and Open Source software released for this problem.

A final point to make is that none of these solutions provide a version for Linux based operating systems, whilst this project should be useable on Mac, PC and Linux based operating systems.
