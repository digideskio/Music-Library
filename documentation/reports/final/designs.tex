\subsubsection{Class diagrams and mind map}
The class structure design process started with a mind map to initially appraise the connection between each musical symbol. This helped break down a piece from a musician's view, and showed what information would be necessary between each symbol's class.

An initial class diagram was drawn from the mind map. This was modified during the course of development, testing and research of the initial model. In particular, other sources such as Music21 were looked at, a toolkit for computer-aided musicology \parencite{Music21}, which helped to examine whether the initial model was missing any classes or attributes. Furthermore, development showed that particular methods, such as the toString method and the Lilypond method could be improved by using inheritance from base classes in order to avoid unnecessary code duplication. The diagrams described are in the appendices.
