The files in this testcase folder are here because they are potential features of a MusicXML file, however, at the current time they are to be ignored
in terms of their output: whilst none of these files should cause
a) the system to fall over completely - in the case of TabStaves and percussion, the drawing portion will throw exceptions, but the GUI should catch and handle these
b) lilypond to not like the input file
Their output will probably not be correct.
